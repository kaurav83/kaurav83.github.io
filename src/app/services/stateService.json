    "description": "Over the last three years Yamaha's Yard Built programme has gone from strength to strength, consistently working with the world's top custom builders to deliver fresh takes on the Sport Heritage range of motorcycles. The latest collaboration, with Belgian builder Fred 'Krugger' Bertrand, takes it to a whole new level with a stunning layer of MotoGP history cleverly woven into the custom Yamaha SR400. There are almost too many custom details to mention as Fred's obsession with perfection spills across the SR400. Motogadget speedo, switches and grips sit behind a tiny custom cowl at the front above a modified top triple clamp and custom handlebars. The brakes and clutch have been given an upgrade and are by Beringer, adding some power over stock to match the supercharged 400",
