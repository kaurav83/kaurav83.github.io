Works claims to have applications for most dual-shock American, European and Japanese street bikes dating back to the 1950s! The Steel Tracker line (seen above) is the most cost-effective option and are made to order. They are great for vintage bikes or baggers where the chrome will either tarnish the bike’s classic looks or be hidden by the bag anyway. Each comes with Single-, Dual- or Triple-Rate springs depending on application, length and load. From there, the customer has the option of choosing chrome springs, threaded preload, and a remote reservoir. Of course, Works has many more options for virtually all of today’s modern bikes, too.",

    "inner_data": "The basic concept is that a triangle (delta) is more rigid than a square. By using a diagonal from the steering head down to the swing arm pivot the frame is triangular versus a rectangular box like a backbone frame. The Delta-box frame using this process offers up to four times the rigidity (less flex) than other designs.",
    "inner_data21": "To give you a scope of how many options Ohlins provides for its shocks, the fitment page on the Ohlins website lists two tube designs (monoshock or twin), five piston diameters, seven shock types, and 11 adjustment features. Luckily, you don’t have to decide which system is right on your own; the fitment guide will help you pick what’s right for your particular model. Visit the Ohlins website via the link above for more information.",
    "inner_data22": "This lightweight, 0.25 -thick polyurethane construction is much lighter than standard aluminum skid plates and helps protect frame, engine, and chassis components. The plate provides a \"smooth\", slick surface so the ATV can \"glide\" over track obstacles.",
    "inner_data23": "These Genuine Yamaha Bearing Kits come with all of the components needed to rebuild the swingarm pivot, shock linkage, and shock bearings. Kits include all of the original equipment bearings, seals, O-rings, and collars your bike came with. Unlike some of the aftermarket companies that use a lower quality bearing, these bearings are O-ring sealed to prevent intrusion of dirt, mud, and water and are made of top quality materials. If you don't want to do the job again and in half the time your original bearings lasted, use these Genuine Yamaha kits.",
    "inner_data13": "What makes this integration possible is an electronic control system featuring a 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). It measures acceleration in the forward-backward, up-down and right-left directions and the angular velocity in the machine’s pitch, roll and yaw directions, then calculates and relays that information in real-time to the bike’s systems to control the engine and the behavior of the chassis to assist the rider.",
